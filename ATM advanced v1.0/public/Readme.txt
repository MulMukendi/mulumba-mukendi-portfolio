-Transaction fee applied dynamically for withdrawals and deposits.

5. Data Handling and Validation

The last version wich is the super advanced version will be made shortly.

It will have back-end and database support - a complete real wolrd application.

I Learn new technologies and frameworks by building hands on projects to simulate real world 
systems and development, instead of dying in a world of tutorial hell.

Download the project folder and run it using vite and node package manager.
